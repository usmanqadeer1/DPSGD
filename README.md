# Optimization of Neural Networks Using Damped Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD)
## Introduction
Optimization of neural networks is a significant challenge in deep learning due to their non-convex nature, which can lead to difficulties in convergence, including issues with saddle points and local minima. Traditional methods like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often struggle to achieve efficient convergence in such scenarios. This paper explores the use of Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) and introduces a novel variant, Damped Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD), aimed at enhancing efficiency and convergence rates.

## Methods
### Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD)
PSGD utilizes preconditioning techniques to improve the convergence of SGD in deep learning models. One effective preconditioning method discussed is Kronecker Product Preconditioning, particularly suitable for overparameterized neural networks.

### Damped Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD)
DPSGD introduces a damping factor to the Kronecker factors of the preconditioner used in PSGD. This method aims to further enhance the performance of Kronecker Product Preconditioning by reducing oscillations and improving stability during training. Additionally, DPSGD incorporates weighted averaging within the PSGD framework to achieve faster convergence.

## Key Findings
- **Performance Enhancement:** DPSGD demonstrates a significant improvement in computation time, achieving a two-fold increase in efficiency compared to PSGD.
- **Time Efficiency:** For similar convergence points, DPSGD reduces wall clock time by 57% compared to PSGD.

## Implementation Details
- **Code Implementation:** Included in this repository is a Python implementation of DPSGD, showcasing how the method can be applied to optimize neural network training.
- **Experimental Setup:** Details of the experiments conducted to compare PSGD and DPSGD, including datasets used, neural network architectures, and performance metrics analyzed.

## Conclusion
DPSGD is a promising method for enhancing the efficiency and convergence of SGD in deep learning optimization. By applying damping to the preconditioner and incorporating weighted averaging, DPSGD achieves notable improvements over traditional PSGD methods. Future work may explore further refinements to DPSGD and its application in various deep learning tasks.
